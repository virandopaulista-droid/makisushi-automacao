"""Fast, Drive-free pre-check used by poller.yml as an early-exit gate:
prints DUE (exit 0) if a story/weekly slot looks like it needs posting
right now, or NOT_DUE (exit 1) otherwise, so the workflow can skip the
expensive rclone/Drive-mount steps on the majority of ticks where nothing
is actually due (cron-job.org + GitHub's own schedule both fire every ~15
min, but a real slot only becomes due once or twice a day).

Deliberately conservative and fully independent from poller.py's own
matching logic (never imports it, never touches the Drive, never writes
anything) -- worst case if this check is ever wrong: a wasted mount (same
cost as before this existed) or a post delayed to the next ~15-min tick,
since poller.py's real logic (unchanged) is still the actual authority on
what gets posted. Also treats a missing/unapproved plan as DUE whenever a
slot's time has passed, so poller.py's own "cronograma ausente/nao
aprovado" GitHub Issue warning still fires as before -- this check must
never silently swallow that safety net.
